USER MANUAL: JAVA MANUAL INSTALLER SCRIPT

Overview:
-----------
This script automates the manual installation of OpenJDK 21 for a specific Linux user (e.g. pet-clinic) without using a package manager. It ensures the user exists, downloads the correct JDK tarball, extracts it, and configures JAVA_HOME and PATH.

Requirements:
-------------
1. Must be executed as root (or via sudo).
2. Internet connection required for downloading the JDK tarball.
3. `curl` and `tar` commands available.

Usage:
-------
1. Save the script as asst.sh
2. Make it executable:
   chmod +x asst.sh
3. Run it as root:
   sudo ./asst.sh
4. When prompted, enter the username (e.g. pet-clinic).

After Execution:
----------------
- The user will be created if not already present.
- The JDK will be downloaded into /home/<user>/java/
- JAVA_HOME and PATH variables will be appended to ~/.bashrc for that user.
- You can verify installation by switching to the user and running:
    java -version

Troubleshooting:
-----------------
- Ensure the JDK tarball URL is valid and accessible.
- If java command not found, source the updated bashrc:
  source ~/.bashrc
